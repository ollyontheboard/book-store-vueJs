Using either of the methods above you can just echo out JSON encoded data to be picked up by your app or its components. The biggest downside to this however, is extensibility.

This shouldn’t be a problem if you’re using Vue to add some basic interactivity to a page or area of your Laravel site, but you’ll easily hit a wall trying to force data into packed scripts.",
